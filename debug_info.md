# Debug Information for Profile Image Upload

## Problem
User can select image but upload fails

## What to Check

### 1. Firebase Storage Rules
Go to Firebase Console > Storage > Rules
Should be set to allow authenticated users:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Check Permissions
- iOS: Added to Info.plist âœ…
- Android: Added to AndroidManifest.xml âœ…

### 3. Debug Steps
1. Run app with `flutter run --debug`
2. Try to upload image
3. Watch console for these debug messages:
   - `ðŸ”„ Starting image upload process...`
   - `âœ… Image selected: [path]`
   - `ðŸ‘¤ Driver ID: [id]`
   - `ðŸ“¤ Starting Firebase upload...`
   - `ðŸ“¤ Firebase upload result: [result]`

### 4. Common Issues
- Firebase Storage rules not allowing upload
- Missing permissions
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid driver_id

### 5. Test Firebase Storage Manually
You can test Firebase Storage by uploading a test file through Firebase Console to ensure the bucket is working.

## Next Steps After Getting Debug Logs
1. If image picker fails â†’ Check permissions
2. If Firebase upload fails â†’ Check Firebase rules and internet connection
3. If API call fails â†’ Check backend PHP function and database connection
